This project is company with my master's thesis: 

**A COMPARISON BETWEEN DIFFERENT INTERPOLATION METHODS FOR CHARACTER UPPER BODY ANIMATION**

This project is meant for generating character animation using three common interpolations: Linear Euler interpolation, Spherical Linear Quaternion interpolation and Spherical Spline Quaternion interpolation. 

Given any number of keyframes, the system will generate in-between keyframes using the corresponding algorithms.

The mathematical equations, motion curves and velocity graphs are well studied. My thesis focuses on the perceptional aspect of evaluating these interpolations on upper-body character animation, as upper-body movements are more expressive. Four types of body gestures will be recorded using motion capture technology and to be extracted into limited keyframes. These keyframes will then populate as the animation stimuli.
